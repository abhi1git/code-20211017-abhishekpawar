** Efficiency Improvements **

* In this approach each time when a message will be received in SQS it will invoke lambda
* Also each time a new object file will be created & pushed to S3
* Thus leading to a lot of Lambda invocations and S3 storage usage
* Instead we can configure lambda to poll the SQS queue for new messages at a certain frequency
* Frequency schedule for lambda invocation can be achieved by Cloudwatch Event Schedule
* Will have to configure more Memory & Timeout values as lots of messages will have to be processed
* Cloudwatch Alarms can be configured to alert when a certain number of messages go undelivered




** Security Improvements **

* IAM roles should be fine grained
* Usage of KMS key for encryption of SQS & S3
* Lambda should be deployed within VPC
* S3 bucket & bucket policy should not be public unless required
